# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

This project is about a fictional bike sharing company, _Cyclistic_, 
that aim to maximize 
the number of annual membership. 
The idea is to analyse how casual riders and annual members use 
Cyclistic bikes differently and understand how they can have the casual 
riders to buy a membership.

Cyclistic has more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. 
It sets itself apart by offering a very large selection of bikes, 
especially they look at people with disabilities 
and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. 
Statistically speaking, 92% of Cyclistic users use standard bikes,
moreover, only about the 30% of the total number of users use them to
commute to work each day.

The company before this analysis has  very flexible pricing plans:
single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. 
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes 
are referred to as casual riders. 
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Since the annual membership is the most profitable, the company's director 
of marketing suggests that increasing the number of annual memberships 
is key to future growth.
